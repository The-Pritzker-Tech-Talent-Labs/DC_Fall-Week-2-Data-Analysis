# 🌍 Data Storytelling with Python  
### 🦸 Superheroes & 🐾 Endangered Animals

Welcome to **Day 2: Data Storytelling** — where you’ll explore how data can tell stories about both **fictional heroes** and **real animals**.  
You’ll learn to clean data, visualize trends, and ask meaningful questions using **Python 🐍**, **pandas 📊**, and **matplotlib 🎨** — all inside **Google Colab**.

---

## 🧩 Lesson Overview
| Part | Theme | Notebook | Focus |
|------|--------|-----------|--------|
| 🦸 Part 1 | Superheroes | `superhero_mini_project.ipynb` | Learn pandas basics, cleaning, and bar charts |
| 🐘 Part 2 | Endangered Animals | `animal_endangered_lesson.ipynb` | Analyze real-world animal data, compare species, and tell a story |

Both notebooks are included in this repo. You’ll complete them **in order**, saving your work to Google Drive and submitting your final versions at the end.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Open the Repository
1. Visit the class GitHub link:  
   ```
   https://github.com/The-Pritzker-Tech-Talent-Labs/DC_Fall-Week-2-Data-Analysis
   ```
2. You’ll see two `.ipynb` notebooks in the root folder:
   - `superhero_mini_project.ipynb`
   - `animal_endangered_lesson.ipynb`

---

### 2️⃣ Open Each Notebook in Google Colab
You can launch each notebook directly in Colab by clicking the badges below:

#### 🦸 Superhero Mini Project  
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/The-Pritzker-Tech-Talent-Labs/DC_Fall-Week-2-Data-Analysis/blob/main/superhero_mini_project.ipynb)

#### 🐾 Endangered Animals Project  
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/The-Pritzker-Tech-Talent-Labs/DC_Fall-Week-2-Data-Analysis/blob/main/animal_endangered_lesson.ipynb)

> 💡 *Tip:* If Colab asks for permission to access GitHub, approve it. You’ll then see your notebooks load in seconds.

---

### 3️⃣ Run and Explore
Each notebook contains **instructions right inside** — just read and follow the prompts!

- Click **Runtime → Run all** to execute everything.  
- Pay attention to the **markdown text** (gray boxes with explanations).  
- Answer any **questions or reflections** in the spaces provided.

#### 🦸 Superhero Notebook
- Load the heroes dataset  
- Clean bad values like `-99.0`  
- Visualize average heights by publisher  
- Filter subsets (like all female heroes)  

#### 🐾 Animal Notebook
- Load pre-cleaned animal data  
- Explore traits like weight, lifespan, and speed  
- Choose **one endangered animal** and compare it to similar species  
- Reflect on patterns and conservation insights

---

### 4️⃣ Save Your Work
After completing each notebook:
1. Click **File → Save a copy in Drive**  
2. Rename it with your name:  
   ```
   Superhero_Project_YourName.ipynb
   Animal_Project_YourName.ipynb
   ```
3. Both saved copies should appear in your Google Drive.

---

### 5️⃣ Submit Your Work
When both notebooks are done:

🔗 **Submit Here:**  
[Google Form Submission Link](https://forms.gle/9hzKazbbkj7wnrWv7)  
*(Replace this link with your class submission form.)*

Upload:
- `Superhero_Project_YourName.ipynb`
- `Animal_Project_YourName.ipynb`

Optional: include a short note on one thing that surprised you or a question you’d like to explore next.

---

## 💬 Reflection Prompts
At the end of each notebook, you’ll see prompts like:
- What surprised you in the data?  
- How did cleaning change what you could learn?  
- What new question would you ask if you had more time?

Take a few minutes to respond thoughtfully — it helps connect coding to real-world thinking.

---

## 🧠 Why We’re Doing This
Data scientists use the same skills you’re practicing today:
- 🧹 Cleaning messy data  
- 📊 Exploring relationships  
- 💡 Drawing insights that tell a story  

By the end of the day, you’ll have built **two data stories** — one about *superheroes* and one about *endangered species*.  
Both show how data can help us understand the world (and our imagination) more deeply.

---

## ⚙️ Technical Tips
- If something breaks: **Runtime → Restart and run all**  
- To reset: reopen the notebook from GitHub  
- You can re-run cells as often as you like — experimenting is part of learning!
